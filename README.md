## The App
The user selects which of two NBA player they think has the most points; a correct selected awards the user a point, while an incorrect selection awards the game a point.

## Installation
Load the file 'app-debug.apk' on your Android device, then look for an app named 'Pointsiest'.


## Challenges
Due to a hard disk failure the second half of this project's development was delayed while I recovered files and set up a new development environment.
Subsequently, in the process of restoring the project through git, and merging development branches, I inadvertently overwrote the git history of the original project. My work was maintained but I lost around fifteen previous git commits from the start of the project.
I also lost time to refactor some bulkier parts of the code; in particular MainActivity.java could be better structured.
